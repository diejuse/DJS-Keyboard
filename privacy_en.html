      <h1>Privacy Policy — 𝔻𝕁𝕊 🄺eyboard</h1>

      <p class="muted">
        <strong>Last updated:</strong> January 15, 2026
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>𝔻𝕁𝕊 🄺eyboard</strong> (“the app”) is an Android virtual keyboard developed by DJS.
        User privacy is a fundamental principle of this app.
      </p>

      <p>
        The keyboard is designed to work <strong>primarily locally and offline</strong>.
        Typed content is not collected or sent to external servers.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information processed by the app</h2>

      <p>
        As a keyboard (Input Method), the app <em>may have access to the text you type</em>,
        including potentially sensitive data. However:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Typed content is <strong>not collected</strong>.</li>
        <li>Typed content is <strong>not stored on servers</strong>.</li>
        <li>Typed content is <strong>not shared</strong> with third parties.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All text processing is performed <strong>exclusively on the user’s device</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Dictionary and learning</h2>

      <p>
        The app includes a local dictionary for suggestions and word learning:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The dictionary works <strong>completely offline</strong>.</li>
        <li>Learned words are stored only on the device.</li>
        <li>The user can manually export or import the dictionary.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        No dictionary words are sent to the cloud or to external services.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Permissions used</h2>

        <li><strong>Display over other apps</strong>: used for floating mode and Bubble 🫧 mode.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage access</strong> (optional): to import and export notes, images, drawings, or dictionaries,
          when the user explicitly requests it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Internet connections</h2>

      <p>

        Connections are made only in the following cases:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          When the user uses features that rely on external applications,
          such as online searches, translation, or voice dictation.
          These services are provided by other apps installed on the device
          and are subject to their own privacy policies.
        </li>

        <li>
          When the user opens videos or images with information about addons,
          which are hosted on the app’s official website:

        </li>

        <li>
          When the user makes an in-app purchase to unlock a premium addon.
          Payment processing and purchase verification are handled exclusively
          by Google Play, and the application does not have access to the user’s
          payment information.
        </li>
